            <h2>Cute Babies</h2>
            <p> Cute babies are a bundle of joy wrapped in tiny fingers and toes! They often have adorably chubby cheeks, 
                bright eyes that sparkle with curiosity, and the most contagious giggles. Their innocence and wonder as they 
                explore the world around them are heartwarming. From their contagious smiles to their little babbles and coos, 
                everything about them seems to bring warmth and happiness to those around them. The way they curl their tiny fingers
                 around yours or cuddle up while sleeping is just too precious for words! </p>

            <h2> Why Babies Are So Cute  </h2>
            <p>Their soft skin and chubby limbs may even make them feel cute. Together, these aesthetic qualities act as a crucial mechanism 
                that enables babies to attract us through all our senses. Babies need constant attention and care to survive, and cuteness is 
                one of the main ways they get it.</p>
